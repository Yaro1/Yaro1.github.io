Hi everyone! Thank you for visiting my homepage. I hope you will enjoy it. 

I'm a very competitive, enthusiastic engineer who doesn't know anything. I love jogging, skiing, reading books, algorithms, data structures and participating in open source projects. 

My goal is to learn something new every day. 
My dream is that my goal will never change.
